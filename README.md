### Drink

#### Beer Gardens

- [Radegast](https://radegasthall.com/): German-style beer hall with a live (and lively!) brass band. Best enjoyed by the liter.
- [Standard Biergarten](https://www.standardhotels.com/new-york/features/biergarten-nyc): Another German-style beer hall, albeit several degrees less rowdy than Radegast.

#### Date Spots

- [Am√©lie](https://www.ameliewinebar.com/home-amelie-west)
- [Anfora](http://www.anforanyc.com/): Cocktails in an intimate ambiance.
- [Vin Sur Vingt](http://vsvwinebars.com/location-west-village/): Cozy, authentic-feeling French wine bar. The West Village location might be closed now.
- [Skin Contact](https://skincontact.nyc/): Great selection of natural wines with some very friendly owners.

#### Hidden Gems

- [The Garret](http://www.thegarretwest.com/): Hidden on top of a Five Guys. Walk towards the register and there's a staircase to the left. Great place to take friends who are visiting the city.
- [Pineapple Club](https://pineappleclub.com/): Big fan of the mezcal ginger margarita. The drinks outshine the food.
- [Proletariat](https://www.proletariatny.com/): Craft beer bar. Very small, with maybe half a dozen bar stools.

#### Outdoors

- [Berry Park](http://www.berryparkbk.com/): Nice rooftop, along with an indoor area with lawn games.
- [Freehold](https://www.freeholdbrooklyn.com/): Can be a bit of a scene at times, but fun for groups.
- [Union Pool](https://union-pool.com/): Allegedly used to be a pool supply store, because New York City is chock-full of pools. The frozen margs are tasty, and critically, very strong.

#### Speakeasy

- [Blind Barber](https://blindbarber.com/pages/east-village): Surprisingly good cocktails. Ignore the people ordering vodka sodas and ask for a pisco sour.
- [Employees Only](http://employeesonlynyc.com/): Not quite a speakeasy, but very minimal street presence. Great ambiance and decor, but can get crowded at times.
- [Fig 19](https://www.figurenineteen.com/): Tucked behind an art gallery, albeit a very sparse one. Fun for groups.
- [The Roost](https://newyork.theroostnyc.com/): Walk in through a coffee shop. Fairly good cocktails, great ambiance.

#### Tourist Staples

- [McSorley's Ale House](https://mcsorleysoldalehouse.nyc/): Sawdust on the floors. An institution. Only two choices of beer: light or dark.

### Entertainment

#### Comedy

- [Comedy Cellar](https://www.comedycellar.com/reservation/)

#### Theater

- [Drunk Shakespeare](https://www.drunkshakespeare.com/)
- [Sleep No More](https://mckittrickhotel.com/)

### Food

#### (New) American

- [Four Horsemen](https://www.fourhorsemenbk.com/): Michelin-starred restaurant and wine bar with a great selection of natural wines.

#### Asian

- [Birds of a Feather](https://birdsofafeatherny.com/): Spicy Sichuan food, best enjoyed family-style.
- [Cote](https://www.cotenyc.com/): Michelin-starred Korean restaurant with a delicious (and very reasonably-priced) prix fixe "butcher's feast" meal. Don't miss the cocktails either.
- [The Bao](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/the-bao): East Village soup dumpling spot. The mapo tofu is also tasty.
- [M√°L√† Project](https://www.malaproject.nyc/): Contemporary Chinese restaurant. Spicy and delicious.
- [Samurai Mama](https://www.samuraimama.com/): Exceptionally good sushi for a reasonable price. Punches way above its weight class in terms of quality.
- [Thursday Kitchen](https://www.thursdaykitchen.com/): Korean tapas. Impossible to go wrong with any of the dishes.
- [Win Son](https://winsonbrooklyn.com/): Contemporary Taiwanese restaurant. Impossible to go wrong with your order; everything on the menu is delicious.

#### Brunch

- [Jacob's Pickles](https://jacobs.picklehospitality.com/): Large portions of comfort food. Be prepared to leave in a food coma.
- [Tartine](https://tartine.nyc/): Cozy French bistro in the West Village, great for brunch. Corned beef hash is a personal favorite, but it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.

#### Burgers

- [Corner Bistro](https://cornerbistrony.com/)
- [David's Cafe](http://www.davidscafenyc.com/)
- [The Spotted Pig](https://www.thespottedpig.com/)

#### Deli

- [Faicco's](https://www.faiccosnyc.com/): Massive sandwiches. The italian special is my personal favorite.
- [Katz's Deli](https://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/): A New York City staple. Go for the pastrami, don't bother with the other meats.

#### Groups

- [Ivan Ramen](https://www.ivanramen.com/)
- [Kiki's](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/kikis)

#### Pizza

- [Best Pizza](https://www.bestpizzawilliamsburg.com/menu/pies/): Williamsburg pizzaria run by a classically-trained chef. A very solid slice.
